## Foo action

This is the example action that you should use to create any new action.

## Action folder structure

Each action should have:

- README.md explaining the purpose, installation, deployment, testing
- Test setup
- Local setup
- Deployment setup

## Style guides

Each action code should follow code style

- ESLint

## Team collaboration

There should be a clear communicationn between all team members and each action should be treated as a team effort.

Each effort related to action development should be version controller, project managed, code reviewed, tested automatically and manually.
